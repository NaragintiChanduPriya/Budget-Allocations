This is the problem statement:
Enter your budget: This would be the total amount of money you have available to allocate to your expenses.
Enter the proportion of each expense item: Here you would list out each expense category, for example, rent, groceries, transportation, etc., and enter the portion of your budget that you plan to allocate to each category. These proportions should be entered as percentages, and they should add up to 100%.
Ignore further items if proportion exceeds 100%: The instruction means that if you enter proportions for your expense categories that add up to more than 100%, the program should ignore any additional categories you try to enter.
Use ArrayList to store expense proportions: An ArrayList is a data structure in Java that is used to store collections of items. In this case, the ArrayList would be used to store the percentages you entered for each expense category.
Find the amount for each item: Once you’ve entered the proportions for each expense category, and stored them in the ArrayList, the program would calculate the amount of money you have allocated to each category. To do this, it would multiply your total budget (step 1) by the proportion allocated to each category (step 2).
For example, let’s say your total budget is $1000, and you allocate 30% of it to rent, and 20% to groceries. Here’s how the program would calculate how much money you have allocated to each category:

Rent: $1000 x 30% = $300
Groceries: $1000 x 20% = $200
So, in this example, you would have allocated $300 to rent and $200 to groceries.
